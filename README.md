# HICR: Hierarchical Interaction with Cross-coordinate Representation for Trajectory Prediction

---

## 🚀 Overview
HICR is an engineering-oriented framework for motion forecasting that supports both **single-agent** and **multi-agent** trajectory prediction tasks.  
It introduces a **Global–Local Fusion Block (GLFB)** to effectively exchange information across coordinate systems, reducing redundant computation while improving accuracy.  

HICR achieves state-of-the-art performance on **Argoverse1** and **Argoverse2** benchmarks, outperforming baselines such as **HiVT** and **QCNet**.
